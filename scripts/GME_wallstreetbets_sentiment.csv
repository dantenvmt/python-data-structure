Please hear me out and don't ban this post

GOGO recently beat earnings, had insider purchases, has high SI, and a nice ramp for a gamma squeeze.

The Co. Director Robert Crandall recently bought 50,000 shares, which is almost always a good sign for a company. The earnings report showed that earnings per share rose 85.11% over the past year to ($0.07), which beat the estimate of ($0.13). Revenue decreased, but still beat estimates: Revenue of $73,869,000 decreased by 59.96% from the same period last year, which beat the estimate of $73,850,000.

 FY21 revenue outlook was raised from $300 million - $320 million earlier to $310 million - $325 million versus the consensus of $313.37 million. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was raised from $105 million - $120 million prior, to 115 million to $125 million. Capex outlook of $25 million to $30 million is primarily tied to Gogo 5G. Free cash flow guidance outlook $10 million - $20 million including cash interest payments of $71 million.

**They're investing in 5G!**

The enhanced financial flexibility and strong cash flow enabled the company to invest in planned 5G deployment, which will significantly improve the performance of the proprietary ATG network, and drive further market penetration of the AVANCE platform, Chair and CEO Oakleigh Thorne said.

Top it all off with a beautiful double squeeze: Short and Gamma

The SI is 33.86% of float according to [FINTEL](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gogo) and Ortex shows promising squeeze potential as well.

Now the pretty part:

A gamma squeeze. The beautiful earnings report brought the 11c ITM. This will cause a ton of contracts to require coverage. If these contracts are exercised, it more than doubles the 10-day volume average of 1.7 million.

49,"YOLO on PBI and Why*This is NOT financial advice just me and my ramblings.* 

Just wanted to share a stupid move of mine and why so maybe I can get some encouragement for this ape.  First, I made some  💲💲💲 off of the GME squeeze (1st one).  I started to look for another multi-bagger 🚀🚀🚀.  Trying to raise some dough to work on an app idea I have.  I settled on Pitney Bowes $PBI and went YOLO after some weird activity after the recent 4/30 ER.  

Added as much as I could in my brokerage account (Yes I paid tax on my GME gains first):

[PBI YOLO BET](https://preview.redd.it/03dat3pwmrz61.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ebb3a24c4e4f4d03b7bffe7db63a6cdcb3e5b00)

Why you my ask?  I see a better growth story than STAMPS and its market cap is lower, and I like their turn-around story.  Reasons:

1. 4th Quarter 2020 Total Revenue
   1. PBI - Global Ecommerce Division $518million (60% YoY Growth)
   2. STAMPS - $206million (28% YoY Growth)
2. A few mutual funds have written a great write-up on PBI :
   1. Domo Capital: Pitney Bowes Already Transformed and Set to Shock... (Seekingalpha)
   2. Choice Equities Management: [Pitney Bowes Smart Long-Term Buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pitney-bowes-pbi-smart-long-152937767.html)
3. PBI spent heavily in 2020 building Amazon-type warehouses: [New Fulfillment Centers](https://www.investorrelations.pitneybowes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pitney-bowes-expands-ecommerce-capabilities-opening-fulfillment)
4. Reddit post on $PBI a deep value see [DD on Pitney Bowes on StockMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mghwow/dd_pitney_bowes_pbi_the_deep_fucking_value/)
5. Hit piece on Seekingalpha, ""Pitney Bowes is a Healthy Overvalued Company"", has great info in  comments worth reading
6. PBI's use of big-data with IoT, see [Digital Transformation at Pitney Bowes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephendiorio/2021/04/29/enabling-a-digital-transformation-at-pitney-bowes/?sh=1a0d571431cc)
7. Great Interview with the CEO on the Digital Transformation, [CEO Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezxaAP1UOu0)
8. New fact shared on reddit: [Pitney Bowes may be a benefit of USPS's new 10-Year Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf70pv/pitney_bowes_may_be_the_beneficiary_of_uspss_new/)
9. 1st Quarter 2021 (Showing the turn-around is happening)
   1. PBI - Global Ecommerce Division $413million (41% YoY Growth)
      1. Plus Presort $143mill EBITDA=$27mil, SendTech $359mil EBITDA=$122mil
   2. STAMPS - $189.16million (25% YoY Growth)
10. STAMPS cap 3.142B, PBI cap 1.31B (As of 5/14/21 10am)

**Now for the strange event that occurred after a great ER**: Before ER 4/30, PBI stock went north of $9, after ER a sudden drop to the $7 range. It was noted by a few folks on Stocktwits that there were 30K+ CALL OPTIONS for early May and a lot of short-selling activity. 

I had a crazy thought, since the same large MMs seem to be in both STAMPS and PBI, plus PBI is having a greater growth precedence over these last two quarters, could the MMs be playing games while slowly changing their positions, since any large delta will hit the stock price.   At this point, I decided to go full blown **YOLO**.

68,"Corsair (CRSR) Double Down - It's TimeResubmitted because it was taken down for some reason. 

I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  (From May 12th)

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We’ll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&amp;D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

91,"The OG UWMC Guy who Wrote all that DD for you - The YOLO UpdateHey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. 

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around.... 

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge. 

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you. 

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao. 

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah. 

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener. 

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder as they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC. 

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.
