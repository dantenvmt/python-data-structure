30,"AAPL EW analysisHi, I am a 20 year old student who began studying Elliott wave principle recently in hope that it would improve my trading.

Is there anyone who could take a look at my analysis of AAPL stock? Now I do not know any of the indicators, this is purely based on my first impression on the chart employing the EW analysis I have been studying. 

Any opinion will be greatly appreciated, please help this boy out!

Please ignore the small writings, as they are basically me rambling to myself- 

 so in short, I think that the wiggly price action after wave 3 is wave 4 manifesting in a triangle, almost coming to an end, ready for a breakout to fib extension 1 of wave 1.   
I did also consider the sharp low after the wave 3 being the wave 4, but since it is too sharp in relation to the wave 2 and it took such a short time to do so, I figured it would be more reasonable to consider it wave A of a triangle, and so far the trend lines are supporting my theory. 

If it does breakout below C, then I would think that it might be the wave A of a correction, which could possibly retrace all the way back to somewhere between the extreme of wave 1 and wave 4, and that whole impulse being the wave 1 of a strong uptrend. 

This is my possible anticipation, it might sound absolutely stupid to some of you Elliotticians, as it has been only three days since I've started studying EW, and I don't know anything else about trading, this is the first point of my study. So please do give me generous criticism, how to improve! I tremendously appreciate your time, thanks for reading this long ass post.

We all know how hedgies went gay bear against papa elon and got their rectum hurt from inside out. They lost almost $38 billion in the short position . S3 partners also lost as much as 8 Billion on AAPL stock. 

But truth to the matter is, the WS is so much corrupted that they probably got all their money back by attacking similar EV stocks: NIO, XPEV, RIDE

# RIDE:

Beginning of the year 2021 RIDE was a hot stock as EV stocks were taking off. but not for long/ The hedies took a huge bet that they paid 100% fees on their short position, and they succeeded.

# NIO

We can make the same case with NIO. NIO is one of the top EV makers in China. They are delivering cars upto date and keeping up with their cash flow and business. 

Just look at this beauty.

But still the MF media is against this company.

My conclusion is even though it seems like the hedge funds lost at the TSLA war but they are constantly winning.
