# The Important Stuff

Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. Anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment ETF, BUZZ, this one wins hands down. **This algorithm has returned 55% since March 2 (when BUZZ came out), compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.**

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \*\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF\*\*. **Important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction.¬†

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

# How is sentiment calculated?

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‚Äòlove‚Äô, ‚Äòenjoy‚Äô, ‚Äòhappy‚Äô, ‚Äòlike‚Äô all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt really like‚Äù as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as ‚ÄúI LOVED‚Äù which is pretty cool. Phrases like ‚ÄúThe turkey was great, but I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the sides‚Äù have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There‚Äôs still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There‚Äôs a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don‚Äôt want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \*\*Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a ‚Äúlong term SPY-beating strategy.‚Äù\*\* I‚Äôm well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

15,"VIAC: God King DD for All My Coked Out FriendsVIAC is a massive media company that is selling at a deep discount and is ready for a breakout. As many of you know due to some hedge fund tom foolery (thanks Bill Hwang) VIAC lost about half of its value. He went out in true WSB fashion, but thanks to him he have some WSB opportunities.

VIAC is an old media company that has lots of appealing properties, and now has recently announced they are focusing on streaming services. In their streaming service portfolio they have Paramount+, Pluto, and Showtime with Paramount+ being their new darling garnering lots of attention.

Now many have pointed out how VIAC has an extremely low P/E, great earnings reports, and more, but repeating that would be a waste of your time and mine. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/) post if you want to learn more.

Today I would like to point a few things out that many of us haven't noticed that are food for thought:

1.Paramount+ is doing better than many would have you believe.

https://preview.redd.it/rrfh4lw9ch871.png?width=1974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe1effae0ad2e94b4fa92682586a6ae01074b692

Now Google Trends is no guarantee for sales, but it is a good indicator of interest. I have heard lots of slander on how Paramount+ has no good shows or how it can't compete with others in the field, but frankly I disagree. Their library is impressive if you dig into it and they are adding thousands of movies as we speak. On top of that, their ad campaigns seem like they are working and streaming has been gaining quarter over quarter for them on lesser streaming services they own like Pluto (seriously who uses Pluto). Paramount+ is gaining steam and that is going to show in the next earnings report.

2. Their Earnings Projections are underestimated

https://preview.redd.it/bl0d0nxuch871.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b1b08b72987d60dd08a48a04230f24eb6a718b0

The current estimates have VIAC underperforming their last quarter. I believe there is no possible way this is the case. Their steaming revenues have vastly increased and the data coming in about their legacy cable networks indicates better than normal performance. For example, there have been reports that their ad cost per million views being higher than normal and that many of their flagship events have been going gangbusters (just see the BET awards ratings if you don't believe me). All signs are showing big revenue coming in that the analysts aren't factoring in, and I believe the earnings surprise is going to be bigger than last time.

3. The Acquisition Rumors

Out of all the major media companies that could be acquired, VIAC is the most likely to happen soon. There has been a frenzie to consolidate rights in media companies and VIAC is an obvious play for many media distributors. They are relatively cheap unlike other options like ROKU (which has been frequently talked about in acquisition rumors) and so it is very likely VIAC will be picked up in the next 6-12 months in the $70-100 dollar range.

Disclaimer: I have a position in this company. Here it is:

So far this week we are in a good range trade area on very low (relative) value. It is a good sign that we can maintain prices even without 150 million shares traded.  AMC is waiting for a catalyst.   If not before the shareholders meeting should be a big factor.  But we may be entering a long sideways period because it is now going to be July and investor action often dries up.  If we believe the S3 data, GME saw significant covering (probably those who shorted at 300 or 400) but AMC saw an increase in short interest and we know FTD increased.  So it does not seem like either side is budging. May be more of a siege than a blitzkrieg but we seem to be holding the line.",2021-06-30 20:44:43,0.078,0.787,0.135,0.8838

62,"WHY WKHS IS THE SQUEEZE OF A LIFETIMEIf you have done any research, I believe that it is fairly evident that WKHS would be the easiest next squeeze target.

This post really will not be complicated, it is very simple.

* WKHS has a 40+% SI with only a 2B market cap

What this means is that it would be very easy for the stock to double or so with momentum, and on top of that, a 40% SI is more than enough to have a GARGANTUAN short squeeze, GME levels.

On a technical level:

üì∑

WKHS broke out of its downward channel on June 2nd with 34 million shares traded and rocketed toward $18 before getting rejected.

It has since touched $18 three more times and has started to form a bull flag on the daily. Once we can break this $18 resistance the bull flag will be complete and it should initiate the WKHS gamma squeeze. Not to mention, it has just shown a MACD crossing, which signals a bullish reversal out of its consolidation.

On a fundamental level, although it personally wouldn't be my favorite fundamental stock, it is still very solid:

‚Ä¢ $15B in EV infrastructure in current bi-partisan agreement for infrastructure, Biden admin pushed for $174B.

Electric vehicle infrastructure gets $15 billion in new US bipartisan proposal, new EV rebate to come later - Electrek

‚Ä¢ Biden executive order states (with application to USPS contract):

Consistent with the goals of the President‚Äôs Build Back Better jobs and economic recovery plan, of which his clean energy jobs plan is a central pillar, the order directs the federal agencies to procure carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles to create good-paying, union jobs and stimulate clean energy industries.

FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes Executive Actions to Tackle the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, Create Jobs, and Restore Scientific Integrity Across Federal Government | The White House

‚Ä¢ Owns patents for drones that launch and return to their EV delivery trucks, no one else has this tech let alone actual EV delivery trucks on the road like Workhorse

‚Ä¢ FAA drone approval this year

‚Ä¢ Over $600 million of EV truck orders

‚Ä¢ EV refrigeration prototypes

‚Ä¢ Strategic development agreement with manufacturer of current gas-powered USPS vehicles

‚Ä¢ Ramping up exponential EV truck production with Hitachi

‚Ä¢ Horsefly drone passed all 45 stringent tests that also involved humans, delivered organs

‚Ä¢ UPS now has confirmation of horsefly tech being successful and FAA compliant

‚Ä¢ IKEA continues to be spotted using workhorse trucks

‚Ä¢ Institutional ownership continues to increase

‚Ä¢ Debt-free, $250 Million cash on hand

It has also been trending on WSB for about 2 weeks now and gaining momentum rapidly. I will be very excited to see this play out in the next month or two, or even this week. As for me, I hold calls and shares in WKHS and am a huge fan of the play.

Hope you enjoyed this post, it took quite a bit of time to make!

Thank you! Best of luck to everyone!

Since GME though, the influx of new people (and Bots, and Hedge Fund-Paid Shills) has increased so much, I can‚Äòt tell if someone is truly on about sth. or if a post has been written by big boy manipulators. The Overall IQ of this Subreddit scratches at negative territory, and there hasn‚Äòt been one genuinely ‚Äûgreat‚Äú post on my frontpage from this subreddit for 2 months now. 

Since apparently the situation is only getting worse in here, I‚Äòm quitting this subreddit for good. I‚Äòll go on my own from now and gather additional info from more sensible subreddits. And I KNOW, this subreddit was for retarded bets and all that, but even those aren‚Äòt a thing anymore. Just Millionaires getting cocky by posting  their share positions in the same tickers/companies over and over. I. Don‚Äôt. Care. There have at least been some special picks and reasons for them before GME was athing. 

I hope I can come back here once and not be flooded with posts about the same five companies over and over.

Humans are intelligent, groups of humans aren‚Äòt. Guess that applies to this subreddit. :/

95,"BB over 3 years of June data and a long caseHere is some math using June as our base month for a bullish position.

Date	Open	High	Low	Close	Adj Close	Volume

Jun 01, 2021	11.23	20.17	10.52	12.24	12.24	2,129,362,800

Jun 01, 2020	4.64	5.84	4.59	4.89	4.89	142,716,000

Jun 01, 2019	7.83	9.09	7.10	7.46	7.46	139,959,300

Let's assume you bought on the adjusted close in the following scenarios. We will use 2020 as base year as it's the mid point between 2019 and 2021. One year prior in 2019 it was trading about 52% higher. One year later it was trading 250% higher. If you looked at 2020 as the bottom and held for a year then your assumption is it would improve back towards 2019 highs. In reality it was about 5x times higher than your long thesis of a mere 50% gain. To say the least that is a great return on investment. I think the price point technicals are showing the true trajectory of BB.

 If you used 2019 as your base year you lost 34.5% if you sold one year later in 2020. If you waited two years from 2019 then your return is 64% after 2 years. 

If you just bought the average close and completely miss the high sale and hold then you will get your money back in a year. The most important difference is look at the volume. It is  now about 14.92% higher than in 2020. It is 15.2% higher than in 2019. Who is buying?

Longs and shorts. Are the shorts that much smarter than the longs? Perhaps but probably not. If you look at the short interest it is not remarkably higher. Either short are covering a lot more in the day or some big entity like [Canaccord Genuity](https://www.canaccordgenuity.com/) is shorting on the dark pool. Why? Because the majority of investors are not short oriented. The majority buy and hold and usually sell when they hit a certain paper loss and thus sell creating actual loss. FOMO or overbuying on leverage gets them into buying above a reasonable entry and they aren't willing or able to hold until they get a reasonable return. Many traders thus cut on the first pass near their entry for a small gain or loss. Buying the dip works if your stock has a reasonable chance of going above your entry. Think of the folks that bought the highs of AMC in the upper 20s. Some averaged down and some just held till it hit the 30s. 

Blackberry is rapidly approaching a critical junction. When it rips again then it will likely go  well past this years all-time highs. Why? Because the volume is picking up and more and more traders are seeing the incredible success with both GME and AMC. Institutions are buying and yes they are selling at highs and buying lower down and will repeat the process. They are buying the short position and the paper hand position.

The minute Blackberry hits anywhere above 28 and likely a minimum of 30 and holds then the story will instantly become the story of how Blackberry really was a great turn around. Some monetization event will occur, patent sale goes through and is disclosed or Blackberry monetizes part of its new revenue streams. It will then head towards 75 and 100. Why? Because the big time longs will be ready to make their real profits and start a new acquisition phase. They will most certainly sell higher as shorts cover, new longs enter in that buy in the new highs on the new momentum, and the process repeats till it hits its final higher highs.  

How much could Blackberry make it too? Not going to lie. I'd love to see a GME scenario. If it 420.69 and I'm holding my current share size then, I'd have BB tattoo'd with the price target and I'm afraid of needles. Possible? Sure. Likely, who knows. It can and will eventually hit again the 140s. Why former high and yes professional traders and day traders love to buy and hold on the way to established levels. If the GME scenario actually happened it would probably eventually base out in the mid-100s before getting back to the 200s. Absurd you say? At about twelve bucks if it went up 250% then that is 360. The big whales and institutions will make the same amount by percentage. As more retail buyers show up then those are more sales for the big guys.  

I'm not BB to 1000. I'm still kicking myself for letting NVDA go at 400 though. Meh, it's only money. I've been moderately well to do in my life and poor as dirt. I'm blessed and really think BB is going to make some long sided traders a lot of money.  I hope to be one of them. Buy the dip, buy the rip, buy and hodl, buy and yodel, don't buy, don't care. Most of all  do what works for you. I'm not an advocate for pump and dump. I am an advocate for investing in stocks you like. I am investing and taking profits along the way. I like the underdogs. Been one most of my life. Heck, I root for the Eagles and Panthers, how much more underdog can you get than that? Both though made it to the Super Bowl and won. I think 100 bucks a share is an actual reasonable target for BB be it in 2021, 2022, or 2023.  The same people that said that was a pipe dream are the same ones that said it would never hit 28 or 20 this year. They were wrong. Time will tell if they are wrong again. There is power in retail investors willing to buy and hold.

So are you saying yolo everything tomorrow on the open? No, I'm not a financial advisor. Check my profile. I'm just an ape investor. I trade for a living and do IT. I hopefully will start a doctorate in the fall in theology. In other words, don't bet your life savings on a YOLO play unless you know what you are doing. I didn't yolo it. I did invest a load of investment money on BB and other stocks. I've made money, I've lost money. It happens.

Let me translate to ape. Buy blackberries which are a yummy fruit that is not a banana. HODL and sell and buy a lot of banana. In other words if you don't paper hand then you make a ton of green in time if the pattern above holds.",2021-06-30 20:30:00,0.081,0.751,0.169,0.999

You apes somehow(you pretend to know how) managed to boost a fucking giant stock with 440M shares and tons of shorting, you made this:

You controlled the downtrend and jeopardize the shorters, and you have an opportunity for another short squeeze as they don't yet cover:

&amp;#x200B;

IF YOU ALL APES living in the basement of your parents managed to beat a 440M shares stock to go from $6 to $55, what you can do with a stock with 80M shares and valued $8 because the HF that used to bully AMC now are bullying us?

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)

AMC now has been stabilized, GME same, but this UWMC baby require all of **your help**.

I KNOW that last month you tried this and this was not trending, so I'm here on the root of all of us, asking you to fucking beat the greedy HF, this is an easy one if you all go crazy buying shares, again if you fueled to the moon a 400M shares stock, what can you all do with a 80M shares stock?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, disclaimer I'm just an APE like most of you and this is just a retard idea NOT FUCK1NG FINANCIAL ADVISEMENT. (not that any would consider it).
